            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ cup cocoa powder, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <br>
            <p>Filling:</p>
            <li>¾ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons powdered sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>⅛ cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella)</li>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray a jelly roll or rimmed sheet pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper. </li><br>
            <li>Make cake: Sift flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking soda together in a medium bowl. </li><br>
            <li>Beat eggs and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until tripled in volume, about 5 minutes. Mix in vanilla. Beat in flour mixture on low speed in thirds, alternating with melted butter, until just combined. Pour into the prepared pan (the thickness should be less than 1/4 inch). </li><br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 8 to 9 minutes. Allow to cool completely. </li><br>
            <li>Flip cake upside-down out of the pan onto a new sheet of parchment paper. Remove the used parchment paper gently from the top of cake. Roll cake, starting at one end of the paper, into a tube until it is completely rolled into the parchment. Refrigerate for 2 hours. </li>
            <li>Make filling: Whip cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla together in a bowl with an electric mixer until medium peaks form. Mix in chocolate-hazelnut spread until well combined. </li>
            <li>Unroll cake and spread evenly with filling. Roll up cake with filling, keeping in mind that cake might crack or tear easily. Dust with cocoa powder if you like. </li>
